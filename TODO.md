# Emotes:

While waiting for your turn I would like to show an "Emote" button, once clicked fills the action panel with the following emojis buttons: 🤣, 😍, 😘, 😏, 🤑, 😎, 🫠, 🤨, 🙄, 🤯, 🥶, 🥱, 🥺, 😭, 😡, 💩.
Once the user clicks an emoji it will come out from the top of their seat container with an animation and hide back again. Once the user clicks an emoji the emoji picker "closes" and the action panel goes back to the normal state. If while they are picking an emoji it is their turn the emoji panel closes and the turn actions: "Fold", "Call", "Bet" show.

- More betting buttons: pot bet, etc
- add chips when betting UI
- Tournaments: multi table tournaments, tournament lobby then multiple games/tables generated, players moved when tables get too small
- Poker club: invite members, members notified of events.
- Seasons: allow grouping games into a seasson to get aggregate results
