# To do

- Table ranking - a player can rebuy or add chips during a poker game so it can be hard to know who is winning. I would like to add a ranking which lists the players with the most winnings first. Include also: Win Rate (big blinds per 100 hands), primary metric used to track "luck" in poker is Expected Value (EV) Adjusted Winnings, which highlights the difference between a player's actual results and their expected results based on mathematical probabilities.
- After 1 minute of waiting for a player to act all players which are waiting can "call the clock", if the clock is called player which turn is to act will have 30 seconds to act. If no action the default action will be check/fold.
